# Introduction

<!-- This line is a comment, it will not render in the PDF. You introduce by placing your cursor in a text line and then input  ctrl + shift + C in Windows and cmd + shift + C in Mac.-->

Papers usually start with an introduction. See [this link](https://anthlittle.github.io/files/little_intros.pdf) for some tips on how to write introductions.^[You can also try the full URL: <https://anthlittle.github.io/files/little_intros.pdf>. Oh, this is how you make footnotes.]

# Code

Our code chunk settings make it so that code is by default. We can override this with [code chunk options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).

For example, here I am forcing the code to appear in the PDF.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

1+1
```

# Citations

Citations by default are in Chicago style. For example, you can see @Wickham2016a to learn more about working with R and RStudio. See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html) for more information on how to use other citation styles.

# Figures

## From R

@fig-penguins shows how to plot a figure from R code. See @Wickham2016 for more on how to make pretty plots.^[Notice how we use cross-reference to automate figure labels and citations.]

```{r}
#| label: fig-penguins
#| fig-cap: "An example of how to make figures using `ggplot2`"

ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = body_mass_g) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
```


## From external sources

Sometimes you may want to include a figure that was not made in R. Alternatively, when your data analysis becomes too cumbersome, you may want to make your figures in a separate file, and then import them. @fig-import shows an example.

# Tables


## Pipe tables

You can make tables "by hand" using pipe tables. Like @tbl-pipe shows.

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

: Demonstration of pipe table syntax {#tbl-pipe}

You can even use a [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to make them interactively and then copy and paste in your .qmd file.

## From R

Of course, you can also make tables in R and then print them in a nice format. I like to use the [`tinytable`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/tinytable/) for simple tables.^[You should also consider [`modelsummary`](https://modelsummary.com) for regression-like result tables.]

For example, @tbl-r is made "by hand" with R code. Of course, you can also plot tidy data objects, like @tbl-tidy shows.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-r
#| tbl-cap: "An example of a table made with `tinytable`"


r_table = tribble(
  ~Default, ~Left, ~Right, ~Center,
  12, 12, 12, 12,
  123, 123, 123, 123,
  1, 1, 1, 1
)

r_table %>% tt()
```


```{r}
#| label: tbl-tidy
#| tbl-cap: "An example of a table made from tidy data with `tinytable`"

# table1 is a sample table from the tidyr package
table1 %>% tt()
```


# Conclusion

You can use this template to start writing your paper, then make it your own by customizing it in any way you would like. You can use a [journal-style template](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/) or [make your own](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/formats.html).

# References {.unnumbered}

<!-- References go in the end by default, you can specify their placement with the following divider. -->
