## Overview

We review three options to incorporate data analysis in R into presentations, as well as two options to do so for academic posters.

Unlike the previous section about writing papers, in which we highlighted not having to manually format a document as one of the advantages of typesetting languages like LaTeX or Quarto Markdown, there is not a strong reason to choose one alternative over the other besides aesthetic preferences and presentation goals.

For presentations, we can easily incorporate output into different formats:

1. PowerPoint. This requires exporting figures as .svg files and tables as Word documents^[Technically, you can [create PowerPoint slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/powerpoint.html) within RStudio through Quarto, but I think skipping the point-and-click interface defeats the purpose.]

2. PDF through [Beamer](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/beamer.html)

3. HTML through [revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)

The options are similar for posters. Since they are just static content, the most important part is choosing the right template. The options are:

1. PowerPoint templates for either [classic](https://www.posternerd.com/sciposters-templates) or [billboard](https://www.posternerd.com/billboard-poster-templates) posters

2. Using RMarkdown to create both HTML and PDF posters with the [`posterdown`](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown#getting-started) package, with several template options

## Tips

The general tip for presentations and posters is that you should treat them as advertisement for a paper or project, so you should keep presentation simple and not try to summarize everything.
