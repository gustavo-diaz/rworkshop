## Overview

This is the first open-ended coding session of the academic year. The goal is for each of us to bring a coding-related goal that we want to accomplish within the time allotted.

We will start by taking turns describing what we seek to accomplish, or what we are particularly stuck on, then we will proceed work independent and help each other if needed.

If we happen to stumble into an important topic, we will link to the appropriate resources here.
